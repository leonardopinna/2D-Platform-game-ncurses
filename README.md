# 2D Platform Spaceship Game

This is a game developed by me as a project for the B.Sc. Computer Science Programming course (1st year). 
You are a Hero that has to defeat encountered enemies on every floor, to earn coins to spend in the market to buy new weapons, to kill new and stronger enemies. 

## How to play the game

To launch the game on Unix-based systems, run 
```(bash)
./run.sh
```
when the pwd is the folder of this project.
